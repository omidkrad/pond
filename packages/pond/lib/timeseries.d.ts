/**
 * A `TimeSeries<K>` represents a series of `Event<K>`'s, contained within a `Collection<K>`,
 * along with associated meta data.
 *
 * Each `Event<K>`, a single entity in the Collection, is a combination of:
 * * `Key` of type K (`Time`, `TimeRange`, or `Index`)
 * * `data` of type Immutable.Map<string, any> - corresponding set of key/values
 *
 * To construct a `TimeSeries` you would typicaly use the wire format, which is a data
 * structure passed into one of the helper factory functions. See the constructor
 * docs below for details of this format. It's fairly simple.
 *
 * You can also construct a `TimeSeries` from a list of `Event`s.
 *
 * A `TimeSeries` supports some notion of what timezone it is in, and this can be
 * specified in the constructor. `Event`s in this `TimeSeries` are considered to
 * be in this timezone. Specifically, if they are `Event<Index>`'s an event might be
 * at "2014-08-31". The actual timerange of that representation depends on where
 * you are. Note: an `Index` of "1d-1234" is always a UTC representation.
 *
 * Methods exist to query back out of the `TimeSeries`:
 *
 *  * Specific `Event`s with `at()`, `atFirst()` and `atLast()`, or at a
 * particular time with `atTime()`.
 *  * Meta data can also be accessed using `name()`, `timezone()` and `isUTC()`,
 * along with `columns()` and the `eventList()` or `collection()` itself. More
 * general user defined meta data can be accessed with `meta()`.
 *  * The overall time range of the `TimeSeries` can be queried with `timerange()`,
 * of for convenience also see `begin()` and `end()`.
 *
 * Mutating a `TimeSeries` will always return a new `TimeSeries`:
 *  * Meta data can be modified with `setMeta()`, `setName()` and renameColumns().
 *  * The set of `Event`s can be altered with operations such as `slice()`, `crop()`.
 *  * Or alternatively you can `select()` specific columns.
 *  * You can take the `rate()` of data
 *
 * Basic statistics operations allow you to get percentiles, quantiles,
 * `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`, `count()` etc for any column within the
 * `TimeSeries`.
 *
 * Traversing over the `Event`s in the `TimeSeries` can be done most efficiently
 * with either `forEach()` or `map()`.
 *
 * Reducing data within a `TimeSeries` is a common task:
 *  * `collapse()` will take a list of columns an collapse those down to
 *    a single output column using a function (e.g. sum())
 *  * `fixedWindowRollup()` lets you aggregate into specific time windows
 *    to produce a new series.
 *  * `hourlyRollup()` and `dailyRollup()` similarly
 *  * You can also make a new mapping from a window to a `Collection` out
 *    of the `TimeSeries` with `collectionByWindow()`
 *  * see also static functions for reducing and merging
 *    multiple `TimeSeries` together
 *
 * Fixing or transforming non-ideal data is another important function:
 *  * `sizeValid()` will tell you how many `Event`s are valid
 *  * statistic functions all take a filter function that can filter the
 *    `Event`s being processed to handle missing or bad data
 *  * `fill()` will fix missing data by inserting a new value where undefined,
 *    null or NaN values are found, using interpolation or 0.
 *  * `align()` will change the time position of data to lie on specific time
 *    boundaries using different interpolation methods (e.g. align to each minute)
 *
 * Some static methods also exist:
 *  * `equal()` and `is()` are two was to compare if a `TimeSeries` is the same.
 *  * `timeSeriesListMerge()` can be used to concatenate two `TimeSeries` together
 *    or to merge multiple `TimeSeries` together that have different column names.
 *  * `timeSeriesListReduce()` can be used for operations like summing multiple
 *    `TimeSeries` together

     * You can initialize a `TimeSeries` with either a list of `Event`'s, or with
     * what we call the wire format. Usually you would want to construct a `TimeSeries`
     * by converting your data into this format.
     *
     * The format of the data is an object which has several special keys,
     * i.e. fields that have special meaning for the `TimeSeries` and additional keys
     * that are optionally added to form the meta data for the `TimeSeries`:
     *
     * Special keys:
     *
     *  - **name** - The name of the series (optional)
     *  - **columns** - are necessary and give labels to the data in the points. The first
     *                  column is special, it is the the key for the row and should be
     *                  either "time", "timerange" or "index". Other columns are user
     *                  defined. (required)
     *  - **points** - are an array of tuples. Each row is at a different time (or timerange),
     *                 and each value corresponds to the column labels. (required)
     *  - **tz** - timezone (optional)
     *
     * You can add additional fields as meta data custom to your application.
     *
     * To create a new `TimeSeries` object from the above data format, simply use one of
     * the factory functions. For `Time` based `TimeSeries` you would use `timeSeries()`.
     * Other options are `timeRangeSeries()` and `indexedSeries()`:
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * ```
     * import { timeSeries } from "pondjs";
     *
     * const series = timeSeries({
     *     name: "traffic",
     *     columns: ["time", "in", "out"],
     *     points: [
     *         [1400425947000, 52, 12],
     *         [1400425948000, 18, 42],
     *         [1400425949000, 26, 81],
     *         [1400425950000, 93, 11],
     *         ...
     *     ]
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Another example:
     *
     * ```
     * const availability = indexedSeries({
     *     name: "Last 3 months",
     *     columns: ["index", "uptime", incidents],
     *     points: [
     *         ["2015-06", "100%", 0], // 2015-06 specified here for June 2015
     *         ["2015-05", "92%", 2],
     *         ["2015-04", "87%", 5]
     *     ]
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Alternatively, you can construct a `TimeSeries` with a list of events.
     * To do this you need to use the `TimeSeries` constructor directly.
     *
     * These may be `TimeEvents`, `TimeRangeEvents` or `IndexedEvents`:
     *
     * ```
     * import { TimeSeries } from "pondjs"
     * const events = [];
     * events.push(timeEvent(time(new Date(2015, 7, 1)), Immutable.Map({ value: 27 })));
     * events.push(timeEvent(time(new Date(2015, 8, 1)), Immutable.Map({ value: 14 })));
     * const series = new TimeSeries({
     *     name: "events",
     *     events: Immutable.List(events)
     * });
     * ```
